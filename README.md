# Habit Tracker
UIUC CS 409 - Art of Web Programming Project

## Problem Statement + Motivation
People struggle to find extrinsic motivation to maintain their habits. They miss one day, which
turns into two, which turns into four, and they eventually forget about it. A habit here is
determined by the user. It could be anything from tracking how much they exercised to drinking
a certain amount of water per day. Existing apps do not allow for relative consistency. For
example, if they miss one day, the streak is broken. It makes far more sense to give them a small
buffer, say 1 or 2 days, where if they miss the habit, the streak will still continue.

## User Problems we are solving
Our app will:
1. Make it easier for users to track their habits consistently.
2. Increase habit retention by allowing relative freedom in goal-tracking
3. Allow a source of extrinsic motivation through form of social interaction and leaderboards

## Functionality
1. Add a new habit that the user wants to track
2. Allow user to track habits of two types: <br>
 i) **Binary habit** - Either they did it, or they didn’t. <br>
 ii) **Numerical habit** - Habit that involves a quantity of some sort- read 10 pages a day, drink liters of water a day, etc. Allows user to track the numerical completeness of a particular habit.
3. Allow them to view other users’ habit streaks and also share their own

## Uniqueness
There are apps which are similar to that of our’s like everyday, Habitify, Habitory, Daily Habits.
Our app is unique in that it includes the following improved features: 
- Social connection: <br>
○ Ability to view other users’ habit streaks. <br>
○ Leaderboards: People with the highest streaks will have their streaks displayed
on a leaderboard for everyone to see.
- Tracks two types of habits: binary and numerical.
